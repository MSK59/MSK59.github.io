This is the official GITHUB website for Muhammad Saad Khalid. I am currently a student at Baruch College, looking to further my knowledge and skill-set in my path to becoming a data scientist. A fun fact about myself is that I enjoy exercising, whether that be through sports, weight-training, or cardio.
