## About
This is the official Github website for Muhammad Saad Khalid. I am currently a student at Baruch College, looking to further my knowledge and skill-set in my path to becoming a data scientist. A fun fact about myself is that I enjoy exercising, whether that be through sports, weight-training, or cardio.

## Projects
**COVID Analysis Project**: In this project I analyzed the early global situtation regarding COVID-19. I analyzed how the world collectively responded to it and tried to understand how successful the United States policies were in relation to demographically similar countries.

**Gmail Summary Automation**: In this project I strived to automate a mundane and repetitive task that most people have to deal with on a daily purpose, reading emails. Using Gmails API I got permission to access and read emails. I dissected the emails and put them as part of a prompt into Grok AI to summarize and grade the importance of. The results were outputted into a CSV.

**Quantum Machine Learning REU**: In electrical power systems, AC Power Flow (ACPF) equations are used to model the flow of electricity across bus-systems and manage the performance of power grids. They present significant computational challenges due to their nonlinear, nonconvex constraints, making real-time optimization difficult. This study proposes benchmarking Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) against Classical Feed-Forward Neural Networks for approximating ACPF solutions across multi-bus system configurations. The Classical Neural network takes the active (P) and reactive (Q) power as inputs and outputs the voltage magnitude (V) and angle (theta). Our QNN encodes P and Q values onto individual qubits through angle embeddings. For an N-bus system, it extracts both V and theta predictions per bus from Pauli X and Z measurements on a single qubit, making it an N-qubit QNN. We evaluate both neural networks with the same number of neurons (N), over different bus configurations with an equal number of layers for both networks. The quantum neural network performed up to twice as well as the Classical Neural Network when measuring Mean-Squared Error, suggesting potential resource advantages when scaled.
